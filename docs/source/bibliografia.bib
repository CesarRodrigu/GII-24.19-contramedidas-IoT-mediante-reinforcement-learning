   abstract = {Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are three sides of the famous CIA security triangle. Since the e- voting systems are built from particular components, the CIA security triangle of these systems has particular definitions for each side. This paper presents these CIA security definitions and criteria which each state-of-the-art electronic voting system must meet based on the view point of National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) and also the criteria proposed by pioneer e-voting researchers. According to jurisdiction of different countries some of the given definitions and criteria might be excluded for developed e-voting system of their territory. Beside of the definitions and criteria, current threats and proposed solutions (in 2012) of each CIA triangle side and current unresolved security threats are concisely described.},

   abstract = {A rich stream of papers and many good books have been written on cryptography, security, and privacy, but most of them assume a scholarly reader who has the time to start at the beginning and work his way through the entire text. The goal of Encyclopedia of Cryptography, Security, and Privacy, Third Edition is to make important notions of cryptography, security, and privacy accessible to readers who have an interest in a particular concept related to these areas, but who lack the time to study one of the many books in these areas. The third edition is intended as a replacement of Encyclopedia of Cryptography and Security, Second Edition that was edited by Henk van Tilborg and Sushil Jajodia and published by Springer in 2011. The goal of the third edition is to enhance on the earlier edition in several important and interesting ways. First, entries in the second edition have been updated when needed to keep pace with the advancement of state of the art. Second, as noticeable already from the title of the encyclopedia, coverage has been expanded with special emphasis to the area of privacy. Third, considering the fast pace at which information and communication technology is evolving and has evolved drastically since the last edition, entries have been expanded to provide comprehensive view and include coverage of several newer topics. The Encyclopedia will be available as a printed volume when it is finished. In the meantime, it is being made available as an online reference work now; it will be updated regularly as more articles arrive and are finalized for publication.},

   abstract = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are difficult to mitigate with existing defense tools. Fortunately, it has been demonstrated that Software-Defined Networking (SDN) with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques has a high potential to handle these threats effectively. However, although there are many SDN-based solutions for detecting DDoS attacks, only a few contain mitigation strategies. Additionally, most previous studies have focused on solving high-rate DDoS attacks. For the time being, recent slow-rate DDoS threats are hard to detect and mitigate. In this work, we propose a modular, flexible, and scalable SDN-based framework that integrates a DL-based intrusion detection system (IDS) and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based intrusion prevention system (IPS) to address slow-rate DDoS threats. We incorporated scalability features into this framework, such as data-plane-based traffic monitoring and traffic flow sampling. Moreover, we have designed a lightweight DRL-based IPS to provide rapid mitigation responses. Furthermore, to evaluate the framework, we deployed a data center network using Mininet, Open Network Operating System (ONOS) controller, and Apache Web server. Next, we performed extensive experiments varying the number of attackers and the rate of attack connections. The proposed IDS achieved an average detection rate of 98%, with a flow sampling rate of 30%. In addition, IPS timely mitigated slow-rate DDoS with 100% of success for a few attackers. Taken together, these results show that the proposed framework provides effective responses to malicious and legitimate connections.},

   abstract = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) flooding attack has remained as one of the most destructive attacks for more than two decades. Although great efforts have been made to design the defense mechanism, it is still difficult to mitigate these attacks in real time smartly and effectively for the reason that attack traffic may mix with benign traffic. Software-Defined Networks (SDN) decouples control and data plane in the network. Its centralized control paradigm and global view of the network bring some new chances to enhance the defense ability against network attacks. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based framework, which can smartly learn the optimal mitigation policies under different attack scenarios and mitigate the DDoS flooding attack in real time. This framework is an effective system to defend against a wide range of DDoS flooding attacks such as TCP SYN, UDP, and ICMP flooding. It can intelligently learn the patterns of attack traffic and throttle the attack traffic, while the traffic of benign users is forwarded normally. We compare our proposed framework with a baseline along with a popular state-of-the-art router throttling method. The experimental results show that our approach can outperform both of them in five attacking scenarios with different attack dynamics significantly.},

   abstract = {The cybersecurity threat landscape has lately become overly complex. Threat actors leverage weaknesses in the network and endpoint security in a very coordinated manner to perpetuate sophisticated attacks that could bring down the entire network and many critical hosts in the network. To defend against such attacks, cybersecurity solutions are upgrading from the traditional to advanced deep and machine learning defense mechanisms for threat detection and protection. The application of these techniques has been reviewed well in the scientific literature. Deep Reinforcement Learning has shown great promise in developing AI solutions for areas that had earlier required advanced human cognizance. Different techniques and algorithms under deep reinforcement learning have shown great promise in applications ranging from games to industrial processes, where it is claimed to augment systems with general AI capabilities. These algorithms have recently also been used in cybersecurity, especially in threat detection and protection, where these are showing state-of-the-art results. Unlike supervised machine learning and deep learning, deep reinforcement learning is used in more diverse ways and is empowering many innovative applications in the threat defense landscape. However, there does not exist any comprehensive review of deep reinforcement learning applications in advanced cybersecurity threat detection and protection. Therefore, in this paper, we intend to fill this gap and provide a comprehensive review of the different applications of deep reinforcement learning in this field.},

   abstract = {Users’ security is one of the most important issues in Internet of Things (IoT) due to the high number of IoT devices involved in different applications. Security threats are evolving at a rapid pace that make the current security and privacy measures unsuitable. Therefore, several researchers have been attracted by this domain with the aim of proposing either new or improved solutions to address the problem of security in IoT. Blockchain technology is a relatively new invention in modern IoT applications to solve the security issue. It is based on the use of a public immutable ledger called a blockchain. After conducting a verification process, several parts on a network encode transactions into this ledger. Moreover, Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been used as emerging solutions to improve IoT security. Reinforcement learning (RL) is the most popular machine learning technique proposed to secure IoT systems. Unlike other ML methods, RL can observe, learn and interact with the environment even if it has minimum information about the considered parameters. Various researches have been proposed to treat security problem in IoT based on either RL technique or Blockchain technology or a combination of both techniques. Therefore, we believe there is a need for a comprehensive survey on works proposed in recent years that address security issues using these techniques. In this paper, we provide a summary of research efforts made in the past few years, from 2018 to 2021, addressing security issues using RL and blockchain techniques in the IoT domain.},
