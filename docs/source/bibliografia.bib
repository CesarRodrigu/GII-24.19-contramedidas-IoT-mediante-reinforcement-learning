   abstract = {With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency (cryptocurrency) causing high crypto mining activity, crypto mining requires large resources so that many cybercriminals carry out illegal activities by stealing access to other people's computers to be used to mine cryptocurrencies (cryptojacking), this can interfere with the performance of a computer if the computer is used illegally without the knowledge of the computer owner, apart from that crypto mining also runs by utilizing the internet network, CPU usage and the power source from the victim's computer, for this reason this research will implement software as service (Saas) services from Cloudflare zero trust that can detect and anticipate cryptojacking activities on the internet network in order to anticipate attacks, Cloudflare zero trust will be installed on the network using the MikroTik routerboard intermediary, besides that the author will conduct an attack trial (penetrator si testing) by carrying out crypto mining activities on computers in a network and analyzing whether Cloudflare Zero Trust is able to detect and anticipate these attacks.},

   abstract = {Cloud computing is one of the most attractive and cost-saving models, which provides online services to end-users. Cloud computing allows the user to access data directly from any node. But nowadays, cloud security is one of the biggest issues that arise. Different types of malware are wreaking havoc on the clouds. Attacks on the cloud server are happening from both internal and external sides. This paper has developed a tool to prevent the cloud server from spamming attacks. When an attacker attempts to use different spamming techniques on a cloud server, the attacker will be intercepted through two effective techniques: Cloudflare and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification. Cloudflare will block those IP addresses that the attacker will use and prevent spamming attacks. However, the KNN classifiers will determine which area the spammer belongs to. At the end of the article, various prevention techniques for securing cloud servers will be discussed, a comparison will be made with different papers, a conclusion will be drawn based on different results.},

   abstract = {Autonomous vehicles mitigate road accidents and provide safe transportation with a smooth traffic flow. They are expected to greatly improve the quality of the elderly or people with impairments by improving their mobility due to the ease of access to transportation. Autonomous vehicles sense the driving environment and navigate through it without human intervention. And, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is witnessed as a powerful machine learning solution to address a sequential decision problem in autonomous vehicles. The detailed state-of-the-art work in autonomous vehicles using DRL algorithms along with future research directions is discussed. Due to the high dimensional action space, two continuous action space DRL algorithms: Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are chosen to address the complex autonomous driving problem. The proposed DDPG and PPO based decision-making models are trained and tested using the TORC simulator. Both the algorithms are trained for the same number of episodes for lane keeping as well as multi-agent collision avoidance scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to present the comparative performance analysis of these two algorithms, and DDPG is found to perform better in terms of higher reward and faster convergence than PPO. Hence, DDPG is a suitable option in the design of a decision model for autonomous driving.},

   abstract = {Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a ubiquitous on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm but is significantly less utilized than off-policy learning algorithms in multi-agent settings. This is often due to the belief that PPO is significantly less sample efficient than off-policy methods in multi-agent systems. In this work, we carefully study the performance of PPO in cooperative multi-agent settings. We show that PPO-based multi-agent algorithms achieve surprisingly strong performance in four popular multi-agent testbeds: the particle-world environments, the StarCraft multi-agent challenge, Google Research Football, and the Hanabi challenge, with minimal hyperparameter tuning and without any domain-specific algorithmic modifications or architectures. Importantly, compared to competitive off-policy methods, PPO often achieves competitive or superior results in both final returns and sample efficiency. Finally, through ablation studies, we analyze implementation and hyperparameter factors that are critical to PPO's empirical performance, and give concrete practical suggestions regarding these factors. Our results show that when using these practices, simple PPO-based methods can be a strong baseline in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning.

The goal of Encyclopedia of Cryptography, Security, and Privacy, Third Edition is to make important notions of cryptography, security, and privacy accessible to readers who have an interest in a particular concept related to these areas, but who lack the time to study one of the many books in these areas. The third edition is intended as a replacement of Encyclopedia of Cryptography and Security, Second Edition that was edited by Henk van Tilborg and Sushil Jajodia and published by Springer in 2011. The goal of the third edition is to enhance on the earlier edition in several important and interesting ways. First, entries in the second edition have been updated when needed to keep pace with the advancement of state of the art. Second, as noticeable already from the title of the encyclopedia, coverage has been expanded with special emphasis to the area of privacy. Third, considering the fast pace at which information and communication technology is evolving and has evolved drastically since the last edition, entries have been expanded to provide comprehensive view and include coverage of several newer topics. The Encyclopedia will be available as a printed volume when it is finished. In the meantime, it is being made available as an online reference work now; it will be updated regularly as more articles arrive and are finalized for publication.},

   abstract = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are difficult to mitigate with existing defense tools. Fortunately, it has been demonstrated that Software-Defined Networking (SDN) with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques has a high potential to handle these threats effectively. However, although there are many SDN-based solutions for detecting DDoS attacks, only a few contain mitigation strategies. Additionally, most previous studies have focused on solving high-rate DDoS attacks. For the time being, recent slow-rate DDoS threats are hard to detect and mitigate. In this work, we propose a modular, flexible, and scalable SDN-based framework that integrates a DL-based intrusion detection system (IDS) and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based intrusion prevention system (IPS) to address slow-rate DDoS threats. We incorporated scalability features into this framework, such as data-plane-based traffic monitoring and traffic flow sampling. Moreover, we have designed a lightweight DRL-based IPS to provide rapid mitigation responses. Furthermore, to evaluate the framework, we deployed a data center network using Mininet, Open Network Operating System (ONOS) controller, and Apache Web server. Next, we performed extensive experiments varying the number of attackers and the rate of attack connections. The proposed IDS achieved an average detection rate of 98%, with a flow sampling rate of 30%. In addition, IPS timely mitigated slow-rate DDoS with 100% of success for a few attackers. Taken together, these results show that the proposed framework provides effective responses to malicious and legitimate connections.},

   abstract = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) flooding attack has remained as one of the most destructive attacks for more than two decades. Although great efforts have been made to design the defense mechanism, it is still difficult to mitigate these attacks in real time smartly and effectively for the reason that attack traffic may mix with benign traffic. Software-Defined Networks (SDN) decouples control and data plane in the network. Its centralized control paradigm and global view of the network bring some new chances to enhance the defense ability against network attacks. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based framework, which can smartly learn the optimal mitigation policies under different attack scenarios and mitigate the DDoS flooding attack in real time. This framework is an effective system to defend against a wide range of DDoS flooding attacks such as TCP SYN, UDP, and ICMP flooding. It can intelligently learn the patterns of attack traffic and throttle the attack traffic, while the traffic of benign users is forwarded normally. We compare our proposed framework with a baseline along with a popular state-of-the-art router throttling method. The experimental results show that our approach can outperform both of them in five attacking scenarios with different attack dynamics significantly.},

   abstract = {The cybersecurity threat landscape has lately become overly complex. Threat actors leverage weaknesses in the network and endpoint security in a very coordinated manner to perpetuate sophisticated attacks that could bring down the entire network and many critical hosts in the network. To defend against such attacks, cybersecurity solutions are upgrading from the traditional to advanced deep and machine learning defense mechanisms for threat detection and protection. The application of these techniques has been reviewed well in the scientific literature. Deep Reinforcement Learning has shown great promise in developing AI solutions for areas that had earlier required advanced human cognizance. Different techniques and algorithms under deep reinforcement learning have shown great promise in applications ranging from games to industrial processes, where it is claimed to augment systems with general AI capabilities. These algorithms have recently also been used in cybersecurity, especially in threat detection and protection, where these are showing state-of-the-art results. Unlike supervised machine learning and deep learning, deep reinforcement learning is used in more diverse ways and is empowering many innovative applications in the threat defense landscape. However, there does not exist any comprehensive review of deep reinforcement learning applications in advanced cybersecurity threat detection and protection. Therefore, in this paper, we intend to fill this gap and provide a comprehensive review of the different applications of deep reinforcement learning in this field.},

   abstract = {Users’ security is one of the most important issues in Internet of Things (IoT) due to the high number of IoT devices involved in different applications. Security threats are evolving at a rapid pace that make the current security and privacy measures unsuitable. Therefore, several researchers have been attracted by this domain with the aim of proposing either new or improved solutions to address the problem of security in IoT. Blockchain technology is a relatively new invention in modern IoT applications to solve the security issue. It is based on the use of a public immutable ledger called a blockchain. After conducting a verification process, several parts on a network encode transactions into this ledger. Moreover, Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been used as emerging solutions to improve IoT security. Reinforcement learning (RL) is the most popular machine learning technique proposed to secure IoT systems. Unlike other ML methods, RL can observe, learn and interact with the environment even if it has minimum information about the considered parameters. Various researches have been proposed to treat security problem in IoT based on either RL technique or Blockchain technology or a combination of both techniques. Therefore, we believe there is a need for a comprehensive survey on works proposed in recent years that address security issues using these techniques. In this paper, we provide a summary of research efforts made in the past few years, from 2018 to 2021, addressing security issues using RL and blockchain techniques in the IoT domain.},
